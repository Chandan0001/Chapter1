    <h2 id="page1"> B. 1.1 Read the following sentences and write T for true and F for false statement : </h2>
    <p>1. Nehru disliked the little cell? False</p>
    <p>2. Nehru lived with other prisoners in his cell? False </p>
    <p>3. Nehru was allowed to go out and walk up and down in front of the gate? False </p>
    <p>4. Nehru was imprisoned in the European Lock-up? False</p>
    <p>5. Nehru loved the sight of the Himalayas? True</p>
    <p>6. Spring in Dehra Dun is longer than that in the plains? True</p>
    <p>7. The change from bud to leaf is sudden? True</p>
    <hr>
    <br>

    <h2 id="page2"> B. 1. 2. Answer the following questions briefly : </h2>
    <h5>Question1: How long did Nehru live in his little cell in Dehra Dun Jail?</h5>
    <p>Nehru lived for fourteen and a half months in his little cell in Dehra Dun jail.</p>

    <h5> Question2: Whom did Nehru treat as his old friends ? Can you make friends with them?</h5>
    <p>Nehru treated tufts of grass and bits of stones in the little yard outside his cell as his old friends.
      I cannot make friends with them.
    </p>

    <h5>Question3: Who were the other occupants of the little cell ? Did Nehru like them?</h5>
    <p>Lizards, wasps and hornets were the other occupants of the cell. Nehru liked them.</p>

    <h5>Question4: ‘………. but in Dehra Dun I had one privilege. ‘What is the privilege Nehru is referring to ? Was it
      Nehru’s special privilege?</h5>
    <p>Nehru had the privilege to walk every morning and evening up and down in front of the gate (but not outside the
      gate).</p>


    <p>It was not Nehru’s special privilege. All A and B class prisoners had this privilege.
    </p>

    <h5>Question5: What was European Lock-up meant for ? How was it different from the other jail?</h5>
    <p>The European Lock-up was meant for European convicts. It was different from the jail because it had no enclosing
      wall. A person inside his cell could have a fine view of the mountains and life outside.</p>

    <h5>Question6: ‘Only a prisoner who has been confined for long behind high walls can appreciate the extraordinary
      psychological value of these outside walks and open views.’ What does Nehru mean by this? Explain.</h5>
    <p>In prison, Nehru greatly admired the mountains and enjoyed the traffic on the public highways outside the prison
      gate. But the people outside would not find much to admire them. We appreciate the value of a thing when we aie
      deprived of it. We value freedom when we are confined. Only a thirsty man in a desert knows the value of a drop of
      water.</p>

    <h5>Question7: How did the sight of the towering Himalaya move his heart? What lesson did he derive from the
      mountains?</h5>
    <p>Nehru found a great comfort being in the proximity of the mountains. There was secret intimacy between Nehru and
      the mountains.</p>
    <p>Nehru learned to be calm when he was depressed, sad or lonely.</p>

    <h5>Question8: Which sight does Nehru call ‘gay’ and ‘cheering’? How does he describe it?</h5>
    <p>Nehru calls the budding of bare peepal trees ‘gay’ and ‘cheerful’. He describes it a wonderful sight to see green
      buds all over the naked tree. Then suddenly the buds turned into leaves. It is a mystery. It appears that some
      secret operations’ had been going on behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>He says,”……….. very rapidly the leaves would come out in their millions and glisten in the sunlight about the
      breeze.”</p>



    <h2 id="page3">B. 2.1. Complete the following sentences on the basis of the lesson: </h2>

    <p> One longed for decent habitation, because of a hail</p>

    <h5>3. The prisoners became more observant of nature’s way because</h5>
    <p>The prisoners became more observant of nature’s way because the watched the various animals and insects that came
      their way.</p>

    <h5>4. Nehru wanted to exterminates wasps because</h5>
    <p>Nehru wanted to exterminates wasps because they had stung him.</p>

    <h2 id="page4">Write a paragraph of about 100 words on the following: </h2>

    <h5>a. Ecological balance:</h5>
    <p>Ecological balance means that all living things like plants,

      animals, and humans, along with non-living things like air,
      water, and soil, work together in harmony. This balance helps
      life on Earth continue as it has for many years. However, when we
      pollute the air, water, and soil or use too many natural resources,
      this balance is disturbed. Problems like global warming, the loss of animals
      and plants, and dirty water and air are the result. Since humans are part of nature,
      we need to protect this balance so that life can continue for everyone, including us. </p>

    <h5>b. The need and importance of plantation drives.</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Long ago, our planet was covered in lush <small>(घने और हरे-भरे)</small> green forests. </li>
      <li>These forests were home to countless animals and provided us with air, water, and resources. </li>
      <li>However, over time, we've cut down many trees, leading to a decline in our environment.</li>
      <li>Trees are like Earth's natural air purifiers.</li>
      <li>They breathe in carbon dioxide, a harmful gas, and release oxygen, the life-giving gas we need to breathe.
      </li>
      <li>Fewer trees mean more pollution and less fresh air.</li>
      <li>Trees also help in rainfall and prevent soil erosion.</li>
      <li>They provide shelter to animals and make our surroundings beautiful.</li>
      <li>To protect our planet, we need to plant more trees.</li>
      <li>Plantation drives are a great way to do this.</li>
      <li>By planting trees, we can help reduce pollution, conserve water, and create a greener, healthier environment.
      </li>
      <li>But planting trees is not enough. We must protect them also, so that they grow up into tall and sturdy
        <small>(जल्‍दी न टूटने वाला, मज़बूत, दृढ़)</small> trees.
      </li>
      <li>Let's all contribute to this noble cause and make our planet a better place for future generations.</li>

    <h2 id="page5">B. 2. 2. Answer the following questions briefly:</h2>
    <h5>1. What is the colour of fresh mango leaves ? When do they become green?</h5>
    <p>Fresh mango leaves are initially reddish-brown or chocolate brown in color, but they quickly turn green.</p>

    <h5>2. What made Nehru cooped up?</h5>
    <p>The first five or six weeks of the monsoon break brought heavy rainfall, totaling fifty to sixty inches. This
      made it uncomfortable for Nehru to stay in a small space.</p>

    <h5>3. What made noise like an artillery bombardment?</h5>
    <p>During autumn and winter, the region would sometimes experience thunderstorms <small>(गरज-तूफ़ान)</small>.
      Occasionally,
      hailstones <small>(छोटे गोल ओले)</small> larger than marbles would pelt <small>(फेंकना)</small> the corrugated
      iron roofs <small>(नालीदार लोहे की छत)</small>,
      creating a deafening noise akin to artillery fire.</p>

    <h5>4. Why does Nehru remember 24th of December 1932 ? How does it throw light on Nehru’s Love for Nature?</h5>
    <p>There was a thunder storm and rain all day, on 24th December,
      1932 and it was bitterly cold : Nehru realised it as one of the most miserable days from the bodily point of view
      that he had spent in the prison. It was shivering cold that day. But in the evening there came a sudden change and
      his misery ended as the weather cleared up shortly. The next day—Christmas day was lovely and clear with a
      beautiful view of snow-covered mountains.
      As such Nehru remembers that day very much.</p>

    <h5>5. “I realized that while I complained of loneliness, that yard, which seemed empty and deserted, was teeming
      with life”. Which life is being referred to here?</h5>
    <p>During his confinement <small>(छोटी जगह या सीमा के भीतर रखे जाने की स्थिति; क़ैद)</small> Nehru was prevented
      from indulging in
      normal activities, he felt loneliness. But soon he observed that
      he is not alone there. All sorts of insects were living in his cell
      and the open outer spaces. Those small creatures (insects) had removed the monotony.
      Their presence had brought life in the cell. Nehru had referred the presence of creeping, cwaling or flying
      insects there.
      It had brought life in the cell and the yard.</p>

    <h5>6. How was the problem of feeding the lost baby squirrels solved? What was ingenious about it?</h5>
    <p>Nehru solved the problem of feeding the lost baby squirrels, with the help of a fountainpen filler. A little
      cotton wool had attached to it and made it an efficient feeding bottle.</p>

    <h5>7. What behavior of the parrots does Nehru describe here? Does it have any resemblance to human behavior?</h5>
    <p>While Nehru was in Naini Jail, thousands of parrots were there and many of them lived in the cracked portion of
      the barrack walls. Sometimes there were fierce quarrels between the two male parrots over a lady parrot, to show
      their superiority and then sit calmly to see the reaction of the female parrot, as to whom she agreed to marry.
    </p>
    <p>Such type of tendency is also found in human behaviour. They also have the same Psychological activities and
      reaction to this effect.</p>

    <h5>Original: inadvertantly, interferre, ordinarily, persistance, avoidence, squirrels, occasionally, ingeniously,
      efficiante, erie, presumabily, diversion, centipides, goaler</h5>
    <p>Corrected: inadvertently, interfere, ordinarily, persistence, avoidance, squirrels, occasionally, ingeniously,
      efficient, eerie, presumably, diversion, centipedes, gaoler </p>

    <h5>Ex. 2. Look up a dictionary and write two meaning of each of the following words – the one in which it is used
      in the lesson and the other which is more common:</h5>
