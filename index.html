        <h2 id="page2"> B. 1. 2. Answer the following questions briefly : </h2>
        <h5>Question1: How long did Nehru live in his little cell in Dehra Dun Jail?</h5>
        <p>Nehru lived for fourteen and a half months in his little cell in Dehra Dun jail.</p>

        <h5> Question2: Whom did Nehru treat as his old friends ? Can you make friends with them?</h5>
        <p>Nehru treated tufts of grass and bits of stones in the little yard outside his cell as his old friends.
            I cannot make friends with them.
            </p>

        <h5>Question3: Who were the other occupants of the little cell ? Did Nehru like them?</h5>
        <p>Lizards, wasps and hornets were the other occupants of the cell. Nehru liked them.</p>

        <h5>Question4: ‘………. but in Dehra Dun I had one privilege. ‘What is the privilege Nehru is referring to ? Was it Nehru’s special privilege?</h5>
        <p>Nehru had the privilege to walk every morning and evening up and down in front of the gate (but not outside the gate).</p>


            <p>It was not Nehru’s special privilege. All A and B class prisoners had this privilege.
            </p>

        <h5>Question5: What was European Lock-up meant for ? How was it different from the other jail?</h5>
        <p>The European Lock-up was meant for European convicts. It was different from the jail because it had no enclosing wall. A person inside his cell could have a fine view of the mountains and life outside.</p>

        <h5>Question6: ‘Only a prisoner who has been confined for long behind high walls can appreciate the extraordinary psychological value of these outside walks and open views.’ What does Nehru mean by this? Explain.</h5>
        <p>In prison, Nehru greatly admired the mountains and enjoyed the traffic on the public highways outside the prison gate. But the people outside would not find much to admire them. We appreciate the value of a thing when we aie deprived of it. We value freedom when we are confined. Only a thirsty man in a desert knows the value of a drop of water.</p>

        <h5>Question7: How did the sight of the towering Himalaya move his heart? What lesson did he derive from the mountains?</h5>
        <p>Nehru found a great comfort being in the proximity of the mountains. There was secret intimacy between Nehru and the mountains.</p>
        <p>Nehru learned to be calm when he was depressed, sad or lonely.</p>

        <h5>Question8: Which sight does Nehru call ‘gay’ and ‘cheering’? How does he describe it?</h5>
        <p>Nehru calls the budding of bare peepal trees ‘gay’ and ‘cheerful’. He describes it a wonderful sight to see green buds all over the naked tree. Then suddenly the buds turned into leaves. It is a mystery. It appears that some secret operations’ had been going on behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>He says,”……….. very rapidly the leaves would come out in their millions and glisten in the sunlight about the breeze.”</p>

    

        <h2 id="page3">B. 2.1. Complete the following sentences on the basis of the lesson: </h2>
        <h5>1.	The monsoon rains were always welcome because:</h5>
        <p>The monsoon rains were always welcome because they ended the summer heat.</p>

        <h5>2.	One longed for decent habitation, because of</h5>
        <p>	One longed for decent habitation, because of a hail</p>

        <h5>3.	The prisoners became more observant of nature’s way because</h5>
        <p>The prisoners became more observant of nature’s way because the watched the various animals and insects that came their way.</p>

        <h5>4.	Nehru wanted to exterminates wasps because</h5>
        <p>Nehru wanted to exterminates wasps because they had stung him.</p>
        
        <h2 id="page4">Write a paragraph of about 100 words on the following: </h2>

        <h5>a. Ecological balance:</h5>
        <p>Ecological balance means that all living things like plants, 
            
        animals, and humans, along with non-living things like air, 
        water, and soil, work together in harmony. This balance helps 
        life on Earth continue as it has for many years. However, when we 
        pollute the air, water, and soil or use too many natural resources, 
        this balance is disturbed. Problems like global warming, the loss of animals 
        and plants, and dirty water and air are the result. Since humans are part of nature, 
        we need to protect this balance so that life can continue for everyone, including us.  </p>
