    <p>7. The change from bud to leaf is sudden? True</p>
    <hr>
    <br>

    <h2 id="page2"> B. 1. 2. Answer the following questions briefly : </h2>
    <h5>Question1: How long did Nehru live in his little cell in Dehra Dun Jail?</h5>
    <p>Nehru lived for fourteen and a half months in his little cell in Dehra Dun jail.</p>

    <h5> Question2: Whom did Nehru treat as his old friends ? Can you make friends with them?</h5>
    <p>Nehru treated tufts of grass and bits of stones in the little yard outside his cell as his old friends.
      I cannot make friends with them.
    </p>

    <h5>Question3: Who were the other occupants of the little cell ? Did Nehru like them?</h5>
    <p>Lizards, wasps and hornets were the other occupants of the cell. Nehru liked them.</p>

    <h5>Question4: ‘………. but in Dehra Dun I had one privilege. ‘What is the privilege Nehru is referring to ? Was it
      Nehru’s special privilege?</h5>
    <p>Nehru had the privilege to walk every morning and evening up and down in front of the gate (but not outside the
      gate).</p>


    <p>It was not Nehru’s special privilege. All A and B class prisoners had this privilege.
    </p>

    <h5>Question5: What was European Lock-up meant for ? How was it different from the other jail?</h5>
    <p>The European Lock-up was meant for European convicts. It was different from the jail because it had no enclosing
      wall. A person inside his cell could have a fine view of the mountains and life outside.</p>

    <h5>Question6: ‘Only a prisoner who has been confined for long behind high walls can appreciate the extraordinary
      psychological value of these outside walks and open views.’ What does Nehru mean by this? Explain.</h5>
    <p>In prison, Nehru greatly admired the mountains and enjoyed the traffic on the public highways outside the prison
      gate. But the people outside would not find much to admire them. We appreciate the value of a thing when we aie
      deprived of it. We value freedom when we are confined. Only a thirsty man in a desert knows the value of a drop of
      water.</p>

    <h5>Question7: How did the sight of the towering Himalaya move his heart? What lesson did he derive from the
      mountains?</h5>
    <p>Nehru found a great comfort being in the proximity of the mountains. There was secret intimacy between Nehru and
      the mountains.</p>
    <p>Nehru learned to be calm when he was depressed, sad or lonely.</p>

    <h5>Question8: Which sight does Nehru call ‘gay’ and ‘cheering’? How does he describe it?</h5>
    <p>Nehru calls the budding of bare peepal trees ‘gay’ and ‘cheerful’. He describes it a wonderful sight to see green
      buds all over the naked tree. Then suddenly the buds turned into leaves. It is a mystery. It appears that some
      secret operations’ had been going on behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>He says,”……….. very rapidly the leaves would come out in their millions and glisten in the sunlight about the
      breeze.”</p>

      their way.</p>

    <h5>4. Nehru wanted to exterminates wasps because</h5>
    <p>Nehru wanted to exterminates wasps because they had stung him.</p>

    <h2 id="page4">Write a paragraph of about 100 words on the following: </h2>

    <h5>a. Ecological balance:</h5>
    <p>Ecological balance means that all living things like plants,

      animals, and humans, along with non-living things like air,
      water, and soil, work together in harmony. This balance helps
      life on Earth continue as it has for many years. However, when we
      pollute the air, water, and soil or use too many natural resources,
      this balance is disturbed. Problems like global warming, the loss of animals
      and plants, and dirty water and air are the result. Since humans are part of nature,
      we need to protect this balance so that life can continue for everyone, including us. </p>

    <h5>b. The need and importance of plantation drives.</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Long ago, our planet was covered in lush <small>(घने और हरे-भरे)</small> green forests. </li>
      <li>These forests were home to countless animals and provided us with air, water, and resources. </li>
      <li>However, over time, we've cut down many trees, leading to a decline in our environment.</li>
      <li>Trees are like Earth's natural air purifiers.</li>
      <li>They breathe in carbon dioxide, a harmful gas, and release oxygen, the life-giving gas we need to breathe.
      </li>
      <li>Fewer trees mean more pollution and less fresh air.</li>
      <li>Trees also help in rainfall and prevent soil erosion.</li>
      <li>They provide shelter to animals and make our surroundings beautiful.</li>
      <li>To protect our planet, we need to plant more trees.</li>
      <li>Plantation drives are a great way to do this.</li>
      <li>By planting trees, we can help reduce pollution, conserve water, and create a greener, healthier environment.
      </li>
      <li>But planting trees is not enough. We must protect them also, so that they grow up into tall and sturdy
        <small>(जल्‍दी न टूटने वाला, मज़बूत, दृढ़)</small> trees.
      </li>
      <li>Let's all contribute to this noble cause and make our planet a better place for future generations.</li>

    <h2 id="page5">B. 2. 2. Answer the following questions briefly:</h2>
    <h5>1. What is the colour of fresh mango leaves ? When do they become green?</h5>
    <p>Fresh mango leaves are initially reddish-brown or chocolate brown in color, but they quickly turn green.</p>

    <h5>2. What made Nehru cooped up?</h5>
    <p>The first five or six weeks of the monsoon break brought heavy rainfall, totaling fifty to sixty inches. This
      made it uncomfortable for Nehru to stay in a small space.</p>

    <h5>3. What made noise like an artillery bombardment?</h5>
    <p>During autumn and winter, the region would sometimes experience thunderstorms <small>(गरज-तूफ़ान)</small>.
      Occasionally,
      hailstones <small>(छोटे गोल ओले)</small> larger than marbles would pelt <small>(फेंकना)</small> the corrugated
      iron roofs <small>(नालीदार लोहे की छत)</small>,
      creating a deafening noise akin to artillery fire.</p>

    <h5>4. Why does Nehru remember 24th of December 1932 ? How does it throw light on Nehru’s Love for Nature?</h5>
    <p>There was a thunder storm and rain all day, on 24th December,
      1932 and it was bitterly cold : Nehru realised it as one of the most miserable days from the bodily point of view
      that he had spent in the prison. It was shivering cold that day. But in the evening there came a sudden change and
      his misery ended as the weather cleared up shortly. The next day—Christmas day was lovely and clear with a
      beautiful view of snow-covered mountains.
      As such Nehru remembers that day very much.</p>

    <h5>5. “I realized that while I complained of loneliness, that yard, which seemed empty and deserted, was teeming
      with life”. Which life is being referred to here?</h5>
    <p>During his confinement <small>(छोटी जगह या सीमा के भीतर रखे जाने की स्थिति; क़ैद)</small> Nehru was prevented
      from indulging in
      normal activities, he felt loneliness. But soon he observed that
      he is not alone there. All sorts of insects were living in his cell
      and the open outer spaces. Those small creatures (insects) had removed the monotony.
      Their presence had brought life in the cell. Nehru had referred the presence of creeping, cwaling or flying
      insects there.
      It had brought life in the cell and the yard.</p>

    <h5>6. How was the problem of feeding the lost baby squirrels solved? What was ingenious about it?</h5>
    <p>Nehru solved the problem of feeding the lost baby squirrels, with the help of a fountainpen filler. A little
      cotton wool had attached to it and made it an efficient feeding bottle.</p>

    <h5>7. What behavior of the parrots does Nehru describe here? Does it have any resemblance to human behavior?</h5>
    <p>While Nehru was in Naini Jail, thousands of parrots were there and many of them lived in the cracked portion of
      the barrack walls. Sometimes there were fierce quarrels between the two male parrots over a lady parrot, to show
      their superiority and then sit calmly to see the reaction of the female parrot, as to whom she agreed to marry.
    </p>
    <p>Such type of tendency is also found in human behaviour. They also have the same Psychological activities and
      reaction to this effect.</p>

    <h2 id="page8">B. 3.2. Answer the following questions briefly: </h2>
    <h5>1. ‘Dehra Dun had a variety of birds’. Make a list of the birds that make this variety.</h5>
    <p>Ans: Dehra Dun had a variety of birds and there was a regular jumble of singing and lively chattering and
      twittering. They include the Koel’s plaintive call.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Koels</li>
      <li>Brain Fever birds</li>
      <li>Kites</li>
      <li>Eagles and</li>
      <li>Wild ducks</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>2. Why was “Bird-Fever” named so?</h5>
    <p>The brain fever bird was so named because it wonderfully went on
      repeatin the same notes continuously, in day time and at night,
      in sunshine days and in pouring rain.</p>

    <h5>3. How did the little monkey rescued?</h5>
    <p>The parent (presumably) of the little monkey saw from the top of
      the high wall that a bit of string was tied round the neck of him (the baby monkey).
      A huge monkey suddenly jumped down into the crowd which surrounded the baby monkey.
      The crowd fled terrified and thus the little monkey was rescued.</p>

    <h5>4. We often had animal visitors that were not welcome.
      Name the animals Nehru is referring to.</h5>
    <p>Nehru in his reference is talking of those animals who were frequently
      found in his cells. After thunder storms scorpions were often visible there.
      Snakes were also found. Once a centiped had also visited his cell and was found on his bed in the middle of night.
      These were the animals frequently visling his cells, who were disliked by Nehru.</p>

    <h5>5. “As as matter of fact I welcomed the diversion.” Which diversion is Nehru talking about?</h5>
    <p>Actually prison life is dull enough, and everything that
      breaks through the monotony is appreciated. Sometimes the most unimportant and undesirous
      creatures remove monotony and bring happy change. Nehru was leading a dull and isolated
      life in the prison. In support of his views he described his meeting with snakes, scorpions and centipedes.
      He was neither horrified nor disliked them, rather
      he found them his best companion during his rough and monotonous prison life.</p>

    <h5>6. What made Nehru vault clear out of the bed?</h5>
    <p>In Alipore Jail in Calcutta one night Nehru felt something moving
      slowly over his feet. With the help of a torch he saw a centipede on his bed.
      He jumped out of his bed immediately with wonderful
      swiftness and almost touched the cell wall.</p>

    <h5>7. How did Nehru get tied to some dogs?</h5>
    <p>At Dehra Dun Jail dogs were not allowed.
      But Nehru got tied up with some dogs incidentally there.
      A jail official had brought a bitch. He left her at Dehra Dun Jail,
      when he was transferred to some other jail.
      She became homeless living in a covered drain and picked up bit of uneaten foods
      from the warders. She used to come to Nehru also for the needful.
      He (Nehru) began to feed her regularly.</p>

    <h5>8. What did Nehru do when the puppy fell ill? Do you have a similar experience of your own?</h5>
    <p>One of the puppies, given birth by a bitch, in a covered drain of Dehra-Dun Jail fell ill with a violent
      distemper (a disease of dogs). She gave a shock of Nehru. He nursed her with great care and sometimes he would get
      up a dozen times in the night to look after her. She became all right and Nehru was happy to see his efforts
      become fruitful.
      It was the greatest pleasure for him.</p>
    <p>I remember, similar incident had happened in my life few years back. There was a street dog in my neighbourhood.
      He was regularly visiting my house. I used to wait his coming at my residence and provide him with some bread or
      other cooked meal. One day he did not turn up. The day following I inquired about him and came to know of his
      illness. He was lying in an open space under a tree. I arranged to bring him at my residence and nursed him. He
      became cured within a couple of days.
      It was the matter of great pleasure for me.</p>

    <h2 id="page9">C. 1. Long Answer Questions:</h2>
    <h5>1. Pick out instances that show Nehru’s love for small animals.</h5>
    <p><b>Ans:</b>While in prison Nehru derives pleasure from watching different animals and gives respect even to the
      tiniest animals. His love for small animals comes true with his expression and action. He spent his lonely time in
      association with wasps, hornets, and Lizards. According to Nehru, Creeping, crawling and flying insects living
      there were removing his monotony of life.
      A pair of ‘Mainas’ had got great intimacy with him.</p>

    <p>He developed intimacy with a bitch and her puppies. At Lucknow Jail, squirrels were his best friends. Almora jail
      witnessed his intimacy with a pair of ‘mainas’. In Naini jail there were thousands of parrots. In Bareilly Jail
      Nehru met with a large number of monkeys. In Alipore jail he saw a centipede on his bed at night. It was crawling
      his feet which compelled him to come out of the bed immediately. Some uncalled for visitors like snakes and
      scorpions were also frequently found in his cell or outside the yard.</p>

    <p>The above noted instances shows Nehru’s intimacy and love for small animals.</p>

    <h5>2. How did the parent monkey rescue its baby ? Why does Nehru call its courage “reckless”?</h5>
    <p><b>Ans.</b>Nehru narrates his experience relating to the efforts of parent monkey to the rescue of its baby.
      There was a large colony of monkeys in Bareilly jail. Nehru had referred to a particular incident. A baby monkey
      managed to come down into the barrack of the jail
      compound but he could not climb up the wall again.</p>
    <p>The warder and some convict overseers with some other prisoners caught hold of him and tied a bit sting round his
      neck. The parent, as presumed, of the monkey baby saw it with anger from the top of the wall. Then after a huge
      monkey jumped down into the crowd surrounded the monkey baby. His reckless and abrupt act
      terrified the crowd and the little monkey was rescued.</p>
    <p>Nehru was highly impressed to see this extra ordinary brave act of the monkey.</p>

    <h5>3. Does the parent monkey’s behaviour in saving its baby tell anything about the human nature?</h5>
    <p><b>Ans.</b>The incident which took place in Bareilly jail shows that we are not kind to the animals. It very well
      throw light on human nature. At Bareilly jail, there was a large colony of monkeys. Monkeys used to jump and climb
      hither and thither, creating an interesting scene. In one occasion a baby monkey came down into the barrack
      enclosure but he could not mount up the high wall. The warder and other prisoners caught hold of him and tied a
      bit of sting round the neck. The parents monkeys watched it with angers. Suddenly a huge monkey jumped down
      fearlessly and get the baby monkey freed as the terrified crowd of men fled.
      Thus the baby monkey was rescued.</p>
    <p>Therefore it shows the inhuman behaviour and nature of human beings and their merciless deeds. Had the parent
      monkey did not freed him the
      warder and other prisoners might have penalised him.</p>


    <h2 id="page10"> Question 4 to 6</h2>
    <h5>4. What are the advantages and the disadvantages of the monsoon?
      How did it effect Nehru’s life in jail?</h5>
    <p><b>Ans.</b> Monsoon rains are most pleasant. When after the scorching heat of the summer season we get the
      comfortable showers we become happy. Trees, plants, bushes and creepers, they all become green and gives a nice
      look. But there is another aspect. The torrential rain creates a number of discomforts and trouble.
      Heavy rainfall creates inconvenience and disrupt the days work.</p>

    <p>Nehru had an immense love for nature. He used to feel pleasure in watching the nature. Monsoon was highly
      soothing and pleasant for him. The rain drops of the monsoon was the gift of pleasant atmosphere for Nehru. The
      earth covered with green grassy sheets. But the heavy rainfall was disliked by Nehru. Torrential rain compelled
      him to confine in the jail’s cell. It had caused much discomfort to him as the rain
      water was dripping from the ceiling.</p>

    <p>5. Why does Nehru say that worship and kindness do not always go together?
      How does he show it?</p>
    <p><b>Ans.</b> Nehru says that Indians believe in non-violence and look upon all life as sacred. But they are
      indifferent to them. He shows this by the example of cows. Many Hindus worship cows. But they are indifferent and
      unkind to them. We can see hundreds of stray cows. But no one cares to look after them.
      Indeed worship and kindness do not always go together.</p>

<h5>6. What does Nehru say about people and their patron animals?</h5>
<p><b>Ans.</b>Nehru says that different countries have adopted different animals as their patrons. Those animals are the symbols of their ambition or character. Eagle is the patron animal of the United States and that of Germany. Bull  dog is the symbol of and Germany have adopted the eagle as the symbol of their countries. 
  The lions and bull dog are of England, the fighting cock is of France.</p>

  <p>The bear is of old Russia. These patron animals mould national character. Most of them are aggressive, fighting animals, beasts of prey. It is not surprising that the people who grow up with these examples before them should mould themselves consciously after them and strike up aggressive attitudes, and roar, and prey on others. 
    Nor it is surprising that the Hindu should be mild and non-violent for his patron animal, the cow.</p>
